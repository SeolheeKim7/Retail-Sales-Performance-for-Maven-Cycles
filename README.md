## Project Overview

**Situation**  
You've been brought on as the lead Business Intelligence Analyst at Maven Cycles to build a full BI solution.

**Brief**  
You're tasked with building an end-to-end reporting solution using raw data on sales, products, customer demographics, and store locations.

## Data Model

The data model was built from **8 separate raw Excel files**, each representing a distinct dimension or fact table. These were integrated in Power BI using a **star schema**, centered around the `Sales` fact table.

### Source Files
- `Sales.xlsx`
- `Products.xlsx`
- `Product_Categories.xlsx`
- `Product_Subcategories.xlsx`
- `Customers_Age_Group.xlsx`
- `Customers_Gender.xlsx`
- `Regions.xlsx`
- `Calendar.xlsx`

### Model Design
- The `Sales` table serves as the core fact table.
- Dimension tables (Products, Customers, Calendar, Regions) are linked via one-to-many relationships.
- Columns were cleaned and standardized using Power Query.

## üîç Key Influencer Analysis

Using Power BI's Key Influencers visual, I analyzed what drives higher sales volume (`Quantity_Sold`).

### Insight:
- The **Product Category** "Accessories" was the strongest positive influencer, increasing average quantity sold by 8.95 units.

## Clustering Analysis

To uncover patterns in customer behavior and sales, I used Power BI‚Äôs Smart Clustering on `Quantity_Sold` and `Total Cost`.

### Insight:
- 3 clusters emerged showing distinct sales patterns.
- One cluster represents high-volume, high-cost orders ‚Äî ideal for targeted promotions.

## Recommendations & Business Insights

Based on the analysis from this Power BI project, here are several strategic insights Maven Cycles could act on:

- **Focus on Accessories**: Accessories not only have the highest average quantity sold but also strongly influence sales growth. Prioritize inventory, bundling, and promotions in this category.

- **Target High-Volume Segments**: Clustering analysis identified a high-value customer segment placing large orders. Personalized marketing or loyalty programs could retain and grow this group.

- **Optimize Regional Strategy**: The majority of orders come from the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù region group. Investigate what areas this includes and consider regional promotions or expansion based on this demand.

- **Improve Inventory for High-Selling Products**: Products like bike tubes and kits consistently appear in top-selling categories. Ensure stock levels align with demand to avoid lost sales.

- **Leverage Gender & Age Data**: Use demographic segmentation to tailor marketing. For example, if younger customers favor specific products, align campaigns accordingly.

- **Monitor Quantity_Sold Trends Over Time**: Use time-based clustering to detect seasonal patterns and adjust stock or promotions accordingly.
